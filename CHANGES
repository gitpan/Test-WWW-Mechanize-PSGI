Revision history for Perl module Test::WWW::Mechanize::PSGI:

0.35 Wed Jan  6 14:39:59 GMT 2010
    - override simple_request rather than _make_request, so mechanize
      still handles redirect and other high level stuff for us (patch
      by clkao)
    - use prepare_request so default_headers are added properly. this
      also makes the request_prepare and response_done hooks called,
      so cookies jars are handled without the current hack (patch by
      clkao)

0.34 Sun Jan  3 12:02:29 GMT 2010
    - update the README to reflect the name
    - fix handling of cookies, patch by tokuhirom

0.33 Tue Dec 15 07:12:18 GMT 2009
    - inital release
